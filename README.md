# NEAR AI Answer Engine

An AI-powered answer engine designed specifically for developers and founders building on NEAR. This tool helps you discover open source repositories, stay updated with the latest NEAR documentation, and assists with debugging and optimizing your NEAR apps.

- 🚀 [Quickstart](#-quickstart)
- 🌐 [Deploy](#-deploy)
- ✅ [Verified models](#-verified-models)

### 🚗 Roadmap [WIP]

- [x] Enable specifying the model to use (only writer agent)
- [ ] Add video support for NEAR educational content
- [ ] Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for NEAR codebases
- [ ] Expand Generative UI capabilities for NEAR developers

## 🧱 Stack

- App framework: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- Text streaming / Generative UI: [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs)
- Generative Model: [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)
- NEAR API: [NEAR Protocol](https://near.org/)
- Component library: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- Headless component primitives: [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)
- Styling: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1. Fork and Clone repo

Fork the repo to your Github account, then run the following command to clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/jbarnes850/morphic.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```
cd morphic
bun i
```

### 3. Fill out secrets

```
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Your .env.local file should look like this:

```
# Used to set the base URL path for OpenAI API requests.
# If you need to set a BASE URL, uncomment and set the following:
# OPENAI_API_BASE=

# Used to set the model for OpenAI API requests.
# If not set, the default is gpt-4-turbo.
# OPENAI_API_MODEL='gpt-4-turbo'

# OpenAI API key retrieved here: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=[YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY]

# Tavily API Key retrieved here: https://app.tavily.com/home
TAVILY_API_KEY=[YOUR_TAVILY_API_KEY]

# Only writers can set a specific model. It must be compatible with the OpenAI API.
# USE_SPECIFIC_API_FOR_WRITER=true
# SPECIFIC_API_BASE=
# SPECIFIC_API_KEY=
# SPECIFIC_API_MODEL=
```

_Note: This project focuses on Generative UI and requires complex output from LLMs. Currently, it's assumed that the official OpenAI models will be used. Although it's possible to set up other models, if you use an OpenAI-compatible model, but we don't guarantee that it'll work._

### 4. Run app locally

```
bun dev
```

You can now visit http://localhost:3000.

## 🌐 Deploy

Host your own live version of Morphic with Vercel or Cloudflare Pages.

### Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmiurla%2Fmorphic&env=OPENAI_API_KEY,TAVILY_API_KEY)

### Cloudflare Pages

1. Fork the repo to your GitHub.
2. Create a Cloudflare Pages project.
3. Select `Morphic` repo and `Next.js` preset.
4. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `TAVILY_API_KEY` env vars.
5. Save and deploy.
6. Cancel deployment, go to `Settings` -> `Functions` -> `Compatibility flags`, add `nodejs_compat` to preview and production.
7. Redeploy.

## ✅ Verified models
